# Astronomy Data Analysis_Python

  In this branch:

I was given practice data (file: astro11) to show that I had the competent Python skill to extract the data and do the task given

The data was just a set of random numbers following a certain range. I needed to create a histogram taking into account the data of data for different increments of values.

Then I needed to create a normalized Gaussian Distribution to acts as a best fit line for the histogram to see how good of a fit it was    

Then optimize the histogram accordingly

Similarly I was given another set of data (astro12) to create a scatter plot relation between the x and y axis and in turn create a best fit line and extract all the necessary parameters.
