I was given the absolute magnitude of a star for a period of time, knowing that the star is part of a binary system with another object.

Using the dips in the magnitude, we extracted the data to understand the period of the binary system.

Then using the data set for the phase and velocity of the two stars, I create a best fit line to get the total mass of system, using Kepler's Third Law.  

And from that I get all the relevant information regarding the binary system.
