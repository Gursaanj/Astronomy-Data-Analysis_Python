Using data for the absolute magnitude of star in a globular cluster as a function of B-V passband filter magnitude, I was able to create a fiducial fit to laboratory data and in turn correct the data set for redshift and phase shift.

Using the new plot for the globular cluster (accounted for redshift) I was able to compare than to certain isochrones to see which fits the given data set (globular cluster) allowing me to be able to tell the age of the cluster.
