# Astronomy Data Analysis_Python

In the Master branch, I will only have this read me file as each branch will detail a different project analysis of different astronomical data (as well as a report of the data)

These small mini analysis all use Python to extract data from the observation data we are given about (Usually regarding temperature, distance and periodical data concerning stellar clusters and small Dwarf Galaxies) and then use functions and plot packages to create analytical representations and solutions to certain quandaries.

Actions like repurposing, factoring, integrating, create best fit analysis, creating T-scores and Chi-squares were quite common in each project along with other actions.
