# Astronomy Data Analysis_Python

In this Branch


Using data that shows certain properties and compositions of the sun, I was able calculate the mean molecular mass of the sun and in turn predict (using best fit analysis) how the Pressure, Surface Temperature and density of the sun vary as a function from the center of the sun.

Then use those models to compare (visually and analytically) with the standard solar model.


The difference between the models shows that the data analysis given was not sufficient and does not take into account the quantum tunneling process that take place nearer to the center of the sun (particular talking about surface temperature and degenerate pressure.
